# Coding Work to improve site
- What do you want to know about the reviews? LLM > Then it will pick the particular reviews you want to see
- Consider reworking individual pages - left hand column (Generated Insight). Consider adding Course Metadata, Positive vs Negative count. 
- Maybe change "Review Source Data Notes" to the actual list of sources
- Maybe further add - Sources have multiple fields (links, tag - trusted, high priority, experimental, name, description, type, added date, status)
