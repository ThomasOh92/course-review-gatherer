# Current Situation
- Utils function works well to add Data - should be able to read data as well
- Note - firestore database in test mode - 30 days till expiry (11 Nov), then permissions must be manually configured

- Next step: Create proper database and start pulling data from there to populate cards
- Create one entry for CS50 first
- Have created one document for CS50 - currently tweaking the code so it actually pulls and reads
